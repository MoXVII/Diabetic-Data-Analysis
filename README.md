# Diabetic Data Analysis

The goal of this project is to see whether US diabetic patients are to be readmitted to hospital for their condition at a later data. This is done with the assistance of a logisitic regression model that considers a variety of input paramaters or features and tries to predict if these features will cause readmittance. The dataset used is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008).


## Built With

* [Python 3] - Base Language.
* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) - Online web editor used to produce Python code along with comments in markdown for ease of understanding and clarity.
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) - Python Package allowing for scientific computing using arrays and usage of random number generators.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - Library used for data analysis using dataframes as data structures and reading data from CSV input files.
* [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org) - Python plotting library allowing for visualisation of data in histograms, bar charts and graphs.
* [SKLearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine Learning library in python allowing for model creation and clutering, in particular K Means Clusitering.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) - Python library used with MatPlotLib for colour and visual aspects throughout the project.
* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com) - Text editor used alongside Jupyter Notebook through duration of project.
